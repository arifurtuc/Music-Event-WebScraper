# What is this project?

This project continuously scrapes a website for information using SelectorLib, stores relevant data in an SQLite database, and sends an email notification. 

It is designed to automate the process of gathering information about upcoming tours from a specific website and provide notifications via email for any new events found. It's an automated system that runs at regular intervals to monitor changes in the tour listings.
